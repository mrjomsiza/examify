# Examify

Examify is a production-oriented first version of a Mathematics learning platform for South African students using the 70-20-10 model. This repository now contains a complete Vite/React frontend, Tailwind design system, Firebase integration layer, Cloud Functions for Paystack and Gemini, and setup documentation.

## What is included

- Modern responsive landing page for the Examify value proposition.
- Role-based authentication flows for students, tutors, and admins.
- Protected student, tutor, and admin dashboards.
- Daily exercise logic enforcing today-only completion and locked missed exercises.
- Image submission upload flow using Firebase Storage.
- Peer review flow with marks and comments.
- Tutor tools for covered-topic tracking, free-text reports, and question-paper metadata.
- Admin overview surfaces for payments, tutors, and platform monitoring.
- Firebase callable functions for secure Paystack initialization, verification, recurring authorization charging, and Gemini exercise recommendations.
- Demo-mode data so the app runs before Firebase credentials are available.

## Tech stack

- React 19 + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- Firebase Authentication
- Cloud Firestore
- Firebase Storage
- Firebase Cloud Functions
- Gemini (`@google/generative-ai`)
- Paystack

## Local setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
cd functions && npm install && cd ..
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Copy the example files and add your real values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp functions/.env.example functions/.env
```

Frontend variables:

- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`

Functions variables:

- `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY`
- `PAYSTACK_BASE_URL`
- `PAYSTACK_CALLBACK_URL`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `GEMINI_MODEL`

### 3. Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Optional: run Firebase Functions locally

```bash
npm run functions:serve
```

## Demo accounts

When Firebase is not configured, the app automatically runs in demo mode. Use these accounts on the login page:

- `student@example.com`
- `tutor@example.com`
- `admin@example.com`

Any password is accepted in demo mode.

## Production notes

- Paystack secret keys are only used in Firebase Cloud Functions.
- Gemini calls happen in Cloud Functions so API keys stay off the client.
- Storage uploads create submission documents in Firestore after a successful upload.
- Tutor assignment logic blocks a second active Maths tutor for the same student.
- The current app includes realistic structure for future extensions such as AI moderation comparison, analytics, scheduling, and automated recurring renewals.

## Firestore entities modeled

- `users`
- `students`
- `tutors`
- `tutorStudentAssignments`
- `studentProfiles`
- `studentPerformance`
- `coveredTopics`
- `lessons`
- `exercises`
- `dailyExerciseAssignments`
- `submissions`
- `peerReviews`
- `tutorReports`
- `questionPapers`
- `subscriptions`
- `subscriptionAuthorizations`
- `payments`
- `notifications`
- `settings`

## Next recommended steps

1. Connect a real Firebase project and set Firestore security rules.
2. Deploy Cloud Functions and configure Paystack callback URLs.
3. Replace demo data loaders with full Firestore queries for each dashboard module.
4. Add scheduled functions for recurring renewals and richer AI exercise orchestration.
5. Add end-to-end tests once deployment credentials and emulator workflows are available.
